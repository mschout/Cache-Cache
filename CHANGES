 - released version 0.08
 - renamed the auto_purge option to auto_purge_interval
 - added the auto_purge_on_set and auto_purge_on_get options
 - moved the Auto_Purge and Reset_Auto_Purge methods to BaseCache
   as the instance methods _auto_purge and _reset_auto_purge
 - added the auto_purge option and property to the base cache interface
   and implementations.  This option will call the purge method on
   the cache after the specified interval expires
 - renamed _set_namepsace to set_namespace (i.e., made it public)
 - added the set_object method to the cache interface
 - updated the test scripts and CREDITS file
 - updated the perldoc formatting to look better in HTML
 - removed the $VERSION from SizeAwareCache
 - started version 0.08

0.07 2001-03-27-08-55
 - released version 0.07
 - prepared for initial CPAN release
 - improved Cache::Cache documentation
 - removed last "use IPC::Shareable" 
 - added support in the Makefile.PL to conditionally build the
   SharedMemoryCache, which requires IPC::ShareLite, and thus runs only
   on certain architectures.  Also broke out the IPC related routines
   into the SharedCacheUtils package.
 - started version 0.07

0.06 2001-03-23-08-36
 - release version 0.06
 - added the get_identifiers method to the Cache interface, implemented
   the method for all classes, added a new test, and updated the test 
   scripts
 - added the size property to Object
 - added the _freeze and _thaw methods to the BaseCache class and
   modified all children classes to use them
 - revert to separate freeze and thaws on the memory based caches to
   ensure that cached data isn't modified at any time
 - major rewrite of the size aware cache logic
 - added the CacheMetaData class, which is used to efficiently keep track
   of a size aware cache state
 - refactored the instance specific limit_size routines into the
   generic Limit_Size method in CacheUtils
 - updated the size aware cache implementations to use the CacheMetaData
   and Limit_Size methods
 - improved the SizeAwareCacheTester and updated the test scripts
 - removed unnecessary clone call from the SharedMemoryCache and the
   SizeAwareSharedMemoryCache
 - added exclusive locking on the shared cache for operations that
   will both read and write to the cache
 - replaced the cache_hash_ref instance property in MemoryCache with
   a class property and updated the SharedMemoryCache and 
   SizeAwareSharedMemoryCache modules accordingly
 - started version 0.06

0.05 2001-03-20-10-25
 - released version 0.05

0.04 2001-03-17-10-43

 - started version 0.04

0.03 2001-03-10-12-40
 - released version 0.03
 - made the FileCache more multi-user friendly by allowing a more
   permissive default directory umask, which can also be optionally 
   overridden
 - updated documentation and code style
 - completely rewrote and improved the limit_size method for a major
   performance gain
 - updated the syntax for expiration times to include the [number] [unit] 
   format, e.g. "10 seconds"
 - added the get_object method to the Cache interface, which allows
   access to the underlying cache object (without potentially expiring
   the object)
 - added the get_namespace and get_default_expires_in methods to the
   Cache interface definition
 - updated the MANIFEST
 - checked in preliminary cache benchmarking code
 - fixed bug fixed bug #406030 -- default_expires_in never invoked
