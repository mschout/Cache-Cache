NAME

  Cache::Cache


DESCRIPTION

  The Cache modules are designed to assist a developer in persisting
  data for a specified period of time.  Often these modules are used
  in web applications to store data locally to save repeated and
  redundant expensive calls to remote machines or databases.  People
  have also been known to use Cache::Cache for its straightforward
  interface in sharing data between runs of an application or
  invocations of a CGI-style script or simply as an easy to use
  abstraction of the filesystem or shared memory.

  The Cache package provides Cache::Cache, a generic interface
  for creating persistent data stores.  This interface is implemented
  by the Cache::MemoryCache, Cache::SharedMemoryCache, Cache::FileCache, 
  Cache::SizeAwareFileCache, Cache::SizeAwareMemoryCache, and 
  Cache::SizeAwareSharedMemoryCache classes. 

  This work aggregates and extends the obsolete File::Cache and
  IPC::Cache projects.


CACHE::CACHE VERSUS CHI

  Cache::Cache is in wide use and very stable, but has not changed in years
  and is no longer actively developed.

  L<CHI|CHI> is the successor to Cache::Cache. It adheres to the basic
  Cache::Cache API but adds new features and drivers (e.g. FastMmap and
  Memcached), improves performance, and addresses limitations in the
  Cache::Cache implementation. The authors recommend the use of CHI going forward.
  
  Questions about Cache::Cache and CHI may be directed to the perl-cache
  mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/perl-cache-discuss.


REQUIREMENTS

  Digest::SHA1
  Error
  File::Spec
  File::Path
  Storable


OPTIONAL

  IPC::ShareLite


INSTALLATION

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install


USAGE

  First, choose the best type of cache implementation for your needs.
  The simplest cache is the MemoryCache, which is suitable for
  applications that are serving multiple sequential requests, and
  wish to avoid making redundant expensive queries, such as an
  Apache/mod_perl application talking to a database.  If you wish to
  share that data between processes, then perhaps the
  SharedMemoryCache is appropriate, although its behavior is tightly
  bound to the underlying IPC mechanism, which varies from system to
  system, and is unsuitable for large objects or large numbers of
  objects.  When the SharedMemoryCache is not acceptable, then
  FileCache offers all of the same functionality with similar
  performance metrics, and it is not limited in terms of the number of
  objects or their size.  If you wish to maintain a strict limit on
  the size of a file system based cache, then the SizeAwareFileCache
  is the way to go.  Similarly, the SizeAwareMemoryCache and the
  SizeAwareSharedMemoryCache add size management functionality
  to the MemoryCache and SharedMemoryCache classes respectively.

  Using a cache is simple.  Here is some sample code for instantiating
  and using a file system based cache.

    use Cache::FileCache;

    my $cache = new Cache::FileCache( );

    my $customer = $cache->get( $name );

    if ( not defined $customer )
    {
      $customer = get_customer_from_db( $name );
      $cache->set( $name, $customer, "10 minutes" );
    }

    return $customer;

  Please refer to the perldoc for Cache::Cache and the related
  implementations for complete documentation.

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

  Cache::Cache 0.99 contains the following incompatible changes:

    * Error::Simple is thrown on exceptions

    * the get_identifiers method has been deprecated in favor of the
      get_keys method

    * the internal format of object in a FileCache has been modified,
      necessitating a clearing of the cache while upgrading (make test 
      does this for the standard cache root)

  Also note that Storable is not forward compatible between all 
  releases.  That is, older versions of the Cache will not always
  be able to read objects written by newer versions.  This is
  unlikely to ever be an issue in production scenarios.


ON LOCKING:

  The FileCache backend uses an temp file and an atomic rename to
  avoid requiring a lock during the write.  This has been demonstrated
  to be safe across all platforms to date.

  The MemoryCache backend relies on Perl's atomic write to a hash to
  ensure that a lock is not required.

  The SharedMemoryCache backend uses ShareLite's locking mechanism
  for safety during the write.
