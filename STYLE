                     ===========================
                       Coding style guidelines
                     ===========================


While there is no one ideal style in which to code, there are some
advantages to adopting a common coding style.  This guide helps
outline the style for this project. 



                    -----------------------------
                      Tabs, spaces, and columns
                    -----------------------------

Avoid tabs.  Instead, use exactly 2 spaces to indent code.  Lines
should break at 80 columns.  Whitespace greatly increases readability,
and should be used between adjacent statements.  The exceptions to the
newline between statements rule include blocks of "use" statements
and blocks of variable assignments.  

An example subroutine:

  sub build_something_else
  {
     my ( $self, $p_param ) = @_;

     Assert_Defined( $p_param );

     return $self->calculate_something( $p_param + 1 );
  }


                          -----------------
                            Return Values
                          -----------------

[Initially I advocated using a temporary variable to store the
 return value to increase code readability, but since reading and
 rereading (and re-rereading) Fowler's _Refactoring_, I am inclined
 to agree with him and now support the Remove Temp with Query
 refactoring, which also implies returning the result of a calculation
 directly]

                              ----------
                                Naming
                              ----------


The following naming conventions should be used:


* Variables

  Inside routines, variables should be named "variable_name", all
  lowercase alphanumeric characters, with underscores separating the
  words.

  my $variable_name;

  
  Additionally, it is often a good idea to describe the type of the 
  variable (other than scalars and object instances) in the name.
  Some examples follow:

  my $foo = 'foo';

  my @number_list = ( 1, 2, 3 );

  my $number_list_ref = [ 1, 2, 3 ];

  my $number_list_ref = \@number_list;

  my %alphabet_hash = ( 'a' => 1, 'b' => 2 );

  my $alphabet_hash_ref = { 'a' => 1, 'b' => 2 };

  my $alphabet_hash_ref = \%alphabet_hash;
  
  my $file_cache = new Cache::FileCache( );


* Parameters

  Parameters should be prefixed with 'p_' to assist in readability.  Note
  that I typically leave off the p_ for the $self parameter, and the
  $proto parameter in the constructor.  For example:

  sub add
  {
     my ( $self, $p_value_one, $p_value_two ) = @_;
 
     return $p_value_one + $p_value_two;
  }


* Public static class variables

  This type of variable is written "Public_Static_Class_Variable" and
  is accessible publicly, and can be updated at runtime.  These
  variables are global for the scope of the module.  Note that there
  are very few cases in which this type of variable should not be
  exposed via a class property (see below).

  my $Public_Static_Class_Variable;



* Private static class variables

  This type of variable is written "_Private_Static_Class_Variable"
  and is accessible only to the module itself, and can be updated
  at runtime.  Note that there are very few cases in which this type
  of variable should not be exposed via a class property (see below).
  
  my $_Private_Static_Class_Variable



* Public static class constants

  This type of "variable" is written "PUBLIC_STATIC_CONSTANT" and it
  accessible publicly, and can not be modified at runtime.  These
  constants are global for the scope of the module.  It is often a good
  idea to make these constants available via Exporter as @EXPORT_OK.

  my $PUBLIC_STATIC_CONSTANT = 'foo';



* Private static class constants

  This type of "variable" is written "_PRIVATE_STATIC_CONSTANT" and is
  accessible only to the module itself, and can not be modified at
  runtime.  These constants are global for the scope of the module.
  

  $_PRIVATE_STATIC_CONSTANT = 'foo';



* Public instance methods

  This type of subroutine is written as "public_instance_method" and
  takes $self as the first parameter.  This is part of the public
  interface for a module, and should be documented with pod (see below
  for details about documentation).

  sub public_instance_method
  {
    my ( $self, $p_parameter ) = @_;
  }



* Private instance methods

  This type of subroutine is written as "_private_instance_method" and
  takes $self as the first parameter.  This is not part of the public
  interface, and can be documented inline with perl comments.

  sub _private_instance_method
  {
    my ( $self, $p_parameter ) = @_;
  }



* Public class methods

  This type of subroutine is written "Public_Class_Method" and does
  not take $self as a parameter.  This is part of the public interface
  for a module, and should be documented with pod (see below for
  details about documentation).  You can optionally make use of
  the Static_Params method in CacheUtils to automatically shift the
  parameters if it is called via the class dereference operator rather
  that explicitly via the package's namespace.  (i.e. it is called via
  Class->Public_Class_Method( ) vs. Class::Public_Class_Method( ) ).

  sub Public_Class_Method
  {
    my ( $p_parameter ) = Static_Params( @_ );  
  }


* Private class methods

  This type of subroutine is written "_Private_Class_Method" and does
  not take $self as a parameter.  This is not part of the public
  interface, and can be documented inline with perl comments.  You can
  optionally make use of the Static_Params method in CacheUtils to
  automatically shift the parameters if it is called via the class
  dereference operator rather that explicitly via the package's
  namespace.  (i.e. it is called via Class->Public_Class_Method( )
  vs. Class::Public_Class_Method( ) ).


  sub _Private_Class_Method
  {
    my ( $p_parameter ) = Static_Params( @_ );
  } 




                            --------------
                              Properties
                            --------------

Properties and property accessor methods should be used to provide a
consistent abstracted interface to certain types of data.  In general,
properties accessors are methods that take the form of get_property
and set_property.  Private getters or setters are written
_get_property and _set_property respectively.  Additionally, static
class properties are written Get_Property and Set_Property as a method
on the class itself.  The properties are stored in the $self hash
(assuming the object is a blessed hash) with a key that corresponds to
the first letter uppercase name of the property, preceded by an
underscore.  

An example of writing a scalar instance property "foo" with a public
getter and a private setter:

  sub get_foo
  {
    my ( $self ) = @_;

    return $self->{_Foo};
  }

  sub _set_foo
  {
    my ( $self, $foo ) = @_;

    $self->{_Foo} = $foo;
  } 


An example of writing a list instance property "bar_list" with a
public getter and a public setter.


  sub get_bar_list
  {
    my ( $self ) = @_;

    return @{$self->{_Bar_List}};
  }

  sub set_bar_list
  {
    my ( $self, @bar_list ) = @_;

    @{$self->{_Bar_List}} = @bar_list;
  }




                    -----------------------------
                      Statement and brace style
                    -----------------------------


* if/elsif/else statements

  if ( $condition )
  {
    # ...
  }
  elsif ( $condition )
  {
    # ...
  }
  else 
  {
    # ...
  } 


* for loops

  for ( my $i; $i < 1000; $i++ )
  {
    # ...
  }


* foreach loops

  foreach my $foo ( @foo_list )
  {
    # ...
  }


* subroutines

  sub do_something
  {
    my ( $self ) = @_;

    #...

    return $foo;
  }


* error handling

  my $foo = $self->get_foo( ) or
    throw Error( "Couldn't get foo" );



                         --------------------
                           Module structure
                         --------------------

A the top of each module there should be a copyright disclaimer as
follows:

  ######################################################################
  # $ Id: $
  # Copyright (C) 2001 John Smith  All Rights Reserved
  #
  # Software distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS
  # IS" basis, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either expressed or
  # implied. See the License for the specific language governing
  # rights and limitations under the License.
  ######################################################################

The "Id" keyword is optional, though highly recommended if the code is
being managed with CVS.


After the copyright disclaimer, there should be a blank line, and then
the package declaration:

  package Cache::FileCache;


The "use" statements should be listed in alphabetical order, with the
lowercase modules listed first.  (This is so that "use strict" is the
next line after the package declaration)

  use strict;
  use vars qw( @ISA @EXPORT_OK $PUBLIC_STATIC_CONSTANT );
  use Cache::Cache qw( $EXPIRES_NEVER );
  use Error;
  use Exporter;


Next, list the @ISA and @EXPORT or @EXPORT_OK lists:

  @ISA = qw( Cache::Cache Exporter );
  @EXPORT_OK = qw( $PUBLIC_STATIC_CONSTANT );


Followed by any variables in the "use vars" section:

  $PUBLIC_STATIC_CONSTANT = 'foo';


And any non exported, non "use vars" variables:

  my $_PRIVATE_STATIC_CONSTANT = 'bar';
  my $_Private_Static_Class_Variable;


Write the methods in the following order:

  * public class methods
  * private class methods
  * class properties ( first Get, then Set ) 
  * new ( if the class is to be instantiated )
  * public instance methods
  * private instance methods
  * instance properties ( first get, then set )


Finally, the class should be documented according to this template:

  __END__
